# BabylonJS Learning

This project isn't intended to be a huge professional project, it's only my
journey through the (awesome) documentation of [BabylonJS](https://doc.babylonjs.com/)

## How to use it

You'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to use this project. Once
you've made sure you have it, open a terminal in this folder and then do :

```sh
npm install # required only the first time
npm start
```

After the success of this, you can simply navigate [here](http://localhost:8080/)
